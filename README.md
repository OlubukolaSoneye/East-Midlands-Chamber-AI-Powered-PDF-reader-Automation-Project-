# East-Midlands-Chamber-AI-Powered-PDF-reader-Automation-Project-
East Midlands Chamber (Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire) is the leading business representation organisation in the East Midlands. I worked with a team on a project to create an AI script using AI Agents (Gemini AI) API that outputs data in a table format based of reading a scanned PDF.


Business Context
Did you know that some companies spend an average of 30% to 40% of their time on manual data entry and handling? This involves tasks like copying and pasting data from emails, invoices, scanned PDFs, or spreadsheets into systems. Manual document processing is costly, slow, and error-prone. To enhance the data-driven decision making and accuracy for the company, we leveraged AI-driven automation.
