##  📊 The Business
East Midlands Chambers connects and supports businesses across the east midlands in the United Kingdom, through strategic planning to grow their business. This involves heavy-documentation and presented an opportunity for improvement. I worked with a team of 4, on a project to create an AI script using AI Agents (Gemini AI) API that outputs data in a table format based of reading a scanned PDF to support East Midlands business team.


## 📌 Project Overview
Developed an AI-powered automation script using Gemini API 
to extract structured data from scanned PDF documents.

Built for East Midlands Chamber to convert unstructured 
PDF reports into structured, tabular data.


## 📌 Business Context

Did you know that some companies spend an average of 30% to 40% of their time on manual data entry and handling? This involves tasks like copying and pasting data from emails, invoices, scanned PDFs, or spreadsheets into systems. Manual document processing is costly, slow, and error-prone. To enhance the data-driven decision making and accuracy for the company, we leveraged AI-driven automation.
